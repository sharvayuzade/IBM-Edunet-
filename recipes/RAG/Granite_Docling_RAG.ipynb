        "Welcome to this Granite recipe, in this recipe, you'll learn to harness the power of advanced tools to build AI-powered document retrieval systems. It will guide you through:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Document Processing:** Learn to handle documents from various sources, parse and transform them into usable formats, and store them in vector databases using Docling.\n",
        "- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Understand how to connect large language models (LLMs) like Granite with external knowledge bases to enhance query responses and generate valuable insights.\n",
        "- **LangChain for Workflow Integration:** Discover how to use LangChain to streamline and orchestrate document processing and retrieval workflows, enabling seamless interaction between different components of the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "This recipe leverages three cutting-edge technologies:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **[Docling](https://docling-project.github.io/docling/):** An open-source toolkit for parsing and converting documents.\n",
        "2. **[Granite](https://www.ibm.com/granite/docs/models/granite/):** A state-of-the-art LLM available via an [API](https://www.ibm.com/topics/api) through Replicate, providing robust natural language capabilities.\n",
        "3. **[LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain):** A powerful framework for building applications powered by language models, designed to simplify complex workflows and integrate external tools seamlessly.\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this recipe, you will:\n",
        "- Gain proficiency in document processing and chunking.\n",
        "- Integrate vector databases to enhance retrieval capabilities.\n",
        "- Utilize RAG to perform efficient and accurate data retrieval for real-world applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "This recipe is designed for AI developers, researchers, and enthusiasts looking to enhance their knowledge of document management and advanced NLP techniques.\n"
